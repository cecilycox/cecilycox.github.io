                        <p class='card-text'>
                        My name is Cecily Cox,
                        </p><p>
                            I am very excited about the opportunity to teach and hope to teach all subjects in elementary 
                            education. I would be honored to impact the life of a child in the crucial years of early 
                            education, and I hope you will consider me for an elementary teaching position.
                        </p><p>
                            I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University, where I received 
                            a degree in Human Rights and Sociology. Since graduating, I have worked for political campaigns, 
                            developing and implementing voter engagement strategies. I have also worked as a swim instructor, 
                            student taught as a volunteer in a fourth-grade classroom, taught second-grade elementary school 
                            in the Diocese of San Jose, and currently, I teach first grade in the Diocese of Oakland. During this time, 
                            I learned the basics of differentiated instruction, classroom management, and core curriculum. 
                            These opportunities gave me incredible hands-on experience and solidified my love of educating children 
                            and my ability to manage a large classroom.
                        </p><p>
                            I have also participated in study abroad programs in France, China, Korea, and Israel. I have a strong 
                            grasp of Spanish, French, and Latin, which gives me a unique advantage when it comes to appreciating different 
                            cultures and understanding the different learning styles of English Language Learners
                        </p><p>
                            I am currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching program at Santa Clara University, 
                            where I am working on a cross-disciplinary qualification in early education. I hope to obtain 
                            this qualification in the next two years. I am eager to teach, but also inspired to learn more 
                            about the educational process and the development of young minds.

                                                They would be able to add their own effects to their liking and creativity levels. This would be beneficial for
                                                students who learn differently as they are not structured to standard reading and writing, they would be able to
                                                read their letters and work on their public speaking. This is especially helpful to students who have trouble 
                                                writing. These students would have the option to only record their letter instead of writing it down first.</p>

                                                able to use auditory, visual, and vocal performances.
                                                Also, students who tend to write well are able to write their letters first and then read them to the camera.</p>

                                                For example, students can write their letters physically and then read their letters, 
                                                and also can verbalize their letters directly to the iMovie recorder.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Opening:</strong> Introduce the concept of rhyming words to your students. 
                                                Explain that rhyming words are words that have the same ending sounds.
                                                For example, "cat" and "hat" are rhyming words. Teacher will then read aloud some entries from the book of nursery rhymes, and
                                                emphasize the rhyming words as you go along. After each rhyme, ask students to tell you what rhyming words they noticed.</p>
                                            
                                                <p><strong>Teacher modeling (30 minutes)</strong> Read aloud Hop on Pop by Dr. Seuss. As with did with the book of nursery rhymes, 
                                                emphasize whatever rhyming words you come across. Pause occasionally, and ask students to identify any 
                                                rhyming words they've noticed.</p>
                                            
                                                <p>Teacher will bring out the cards from the flashcard set, and mix them up. Students will be given
                                                rhyming cards and they have to find their partner who has the word that rhymes 
                                                with the card they were presented with.</p>

                                                <p>Students will distribute different My Rhyming Book worksheets to each student. Have students work on
                                                completing their pages.</p>

                                                <p>Students will then watch a Youtube video, which explains to beginners/kids how to use the basic features 
                                                of Garageband:</p>

                                                <p>Students will then be shown how to create and record a short rhyming poem.  As a class, we will
                                                then write a short rhyming poem and record it on Garageband. Finally, the students will be paired up 
                                                into groups of 4 and use their iPads to create a song or poem, which would be recorded on Garageband.</p>

                                                <p>At the end of the week, we will listen to all recordings, and students will clap for each student 
                                                that has presented their audio project.</p>

                                                <p>Advanced students can be given an extra assignment. Have them read Hop on Pop on their own and
                                                write down all of the rhyming words in the book. Support: Have one-on-one review sessions with 
                                                struggling students. Go over different pairs of rhyming words with them to make sure they understand 
                                                the concept of end rhymes. Assessment (10 minutes) Distribute pencils and sheets of paper to
                                                the class. Ask each student to write down three pairs of rhyming words on his sheet. Then,
                                                ask students to write down as many examples of rhyming words from Hop on Pop as they can.
                                                Collect the sheets and look over them after the lesson to assess each student's understanding of 
                                                the material. Review and closing (5 minutes) Remind students of the definition of rhyming words: 
                                                words that have the same ending sounds. Tell them that most songs, nursery rhymes, and poems have
                                                rhyming words. Advise them to keep their eyes and ears open for rhyming words 
                                                whenever they listen to songs or read poetry.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> Students will foster collaboration and community. 
                                                Students will be paired in groups with students of varying abilities.  Together,
                                                students must work together to come up with a few sentences that rhyme.  
                                                They will then have to work together to record an audio file of their poem using Garageband.
                                                This is beneficial for some students who may be uncomfortable writing,
                                                this gives them the opportunity to work orally. Furthermore, students who
                                                do struggle occasionally will have other students to speak with and ask questions 
                                                and discuss creative options for the audio files.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Representation:</strong>Offer alternatives for auditory information.  
                                                In addition to the video, which explains how to use Garageband, there will
                                                be a handout that will go along with the video for students who learn best
                                                by reading information instead of learning from audio files. Additionally, the
                                                nursery rhymes will also be printed out for students who learn best by reading
                                                information instead of audio files.</p>

                                                <p><strong>Action and Expression:</strong>Use multiple media for communication.
                                                Students will be given handouts, videos, and a lecture to understand how to
                                                compose an audio file to record their rhyming sentences, which helps instruct
                                                students who learn in different ways as it offers different types of learners 
                                                various ways to garner information on how to rhyme and use Garageband.

                                                magazine. They will then discuss what they see in the picture. Ask them to read the title.
                                                Discuss the meaning of 'patriotism' and 'allegiance'. Ask the students to think about which
                                                pictures show a monument and which picture shows a landmark. Teacher will continue through

                                                that have to do with each slide. Ask the students if they know the song “Yankee Doodle” 
                                                and "The Star Spangled Banner", teacher will play those songs for students and explain
                                                that these are patriotic songs. Teacher will use the activities on the back of the article to
                                                review the material presented and as an informal assessment of the students’ knowledge 
                                                and understanding of the content presented in this issue. Teacher will then give students an 
                                                example of a Powerpoint slide that gives one example of patriotism. Students will then have
                                                access to PowerPoint via Ipad, and work with a partner to create one slide with either a photo, 
                                                audio, or video that explains their favorite patriotic thing.

                                                Through the Powerpoint slide, students have the option of presenting their

                                                visual representation have a chance to associate a picture with the vocabulary word.

                        <p class='card-text'>TPACK helps teachers understand educational technologies that interact with
                            each other to enable effective teaching with technology (Mishra and Koehler). I
                            understand the three main components of teachers' knowledge: content, pedagogy,
                            and technology, and the interactions among these bodies of knowledge (Mishra
                            and Koehler).</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Technological Knowledge:</strong> I already have knowledge of technological applications
                            such as Kahoot, Rubistar, Garageband, iMovie, Padlet, and EdPuzzle. I would
                            like to learn how to expand my skills with Scratch and other programming
                            languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, and expand my SQL skills. I
                            will learn this technology through online courses from Codeacademy and take a
                            computer science course at a local educational institution or online. I will
                            also keep up to date on the latest educational technologies by visiting the
                            website <a href='https://tech.ed.gov/'>tech.ed.gov</a>, which is a government website that develops a vision for
                            using technology to transform teaching and learning.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Pedagogical Knowledge:</strong> I favor a constructivist approach that allows students
                            to use background knowledge they have acquired in other areas of their lives
                            and integrate it into the technology used in daily instruction. I believe that
                            students should learn to lead their own lessons to maximize their learning
                            potential. Also, students should learn to lead their own lessons using
                            technology and become teachers and creators of their own content. I want to
                            know how to get students to create their own lessons when they are young and in
                            the first grade of elementary school. I want to know what programs are most
                            beneficial in allowing students to create their own lessons. I will learn this
                            by consulting with colleagues and my school's administration about innovative
                            technologies and learning how to use these new technologies, such as the
                            Mathletics application, coding, and other applications geared towards early
                            learning in elementary schools.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Content Knowledge:</strong> In terms of content, I know how to teach early education
                            ELA, math, science, religion, and social studies. I would like to learn how to
                            better differentiate the curriculum for my students, especially students with
                            learning disabilities or students with English language proficiency. I will do
                            this by keeping up to date on the latest innovations and collaborating with
                            colleagues who specialize in ELL and learning differences. I will also practice
                            using T, P, and C and be flexible in these three areas to best meet the needs
                            of my students.</li>

                    <div class='card-body'>
                        <h3 class="card-title">Reflection</h3>
                        <p class='card-text'>This course has been extremely useful to me. Although I grew 
                        up with technology in the classroom, I had never
                        thought much about its impact. My earliest memory of technology was going to my school's computer lab
                        and taking typing lessons. Then I remember my school getting a technology called a smartboard in 2nd grade. 
                        I think smartboards are still used today and my school was one of the first to have this type of technology. 
                        I think I took for granted how important technology was in my life because I was privileged to have a school 
                        that gave me so many opportunities to engage with programs like Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, and even
                        a program called Kid Pix, a bitmap drawing program designed specifically for kids to draw on the computer.</p>
                        
                        <p class="card-text">As a child, I was taught to learn in so many ways that I did not even realize the impact
                        it had on me and my learning career. When I think about it today, technology provided me with a variety of ways
                        to learn and gave me an advantage in my academic career. But just like the world, technology is constantly changing,
                        and programs I used as a child, like Kid Pix, have since been discontinued. Operating systems have evolved to reach
                        exponential speeds and handle multiple coding languages. I never thought about the fact that as a teacher, I needed
                        to be aware of these changes and make plans to help my students prepare for a competitive job market that requires 
                        them to be familiar with current technological skills. Also, I did not realize how much technology was making things more
                        accessible to my students. I really enjoyed learning more about the generations that grew up with technology and 
                        how comfortable our current students are with technology. I have really benefited from constructivism and have
                        come to the conclusion that it is important that as a teacher I promote learning through creativity and not
                        just through the acquisition of knowledge. In addition, constructivism helps us learn through interaction with others
                        and provides us with real world tools and experiences. All of our students have different cultural backgrounds 
                        and experiences. By giving them technology, they can learn by using their own passions and skills to learn the material.</p>

                        <p>Not everyone learns the same way, but programs that allow students to be creative and use different forms of media
                        to allow them to better relate to the information and help them understand a topic by bringing unique and prior knowledge to 
                        the learning situation. I also learned that as a teacher, I need to be aware of copyright infringement because individuals 
                        can get in trouble for unauthorized copying, and teachers should be aware of their rights when it comes to creating media and 
                        using songs and videos written by others. I also found it very interesting to learn about blended learning, because according 
                        to Vanderbilt College, online learning is one of the fastest growing trends in the use of technology in education. Especially 
                        according to COVID -19, institutions are offering a variety of online courses. According to the same article, students who are 
                        taught online perform slightly better on average than those who learn the same material in face-to-face classes. In addition, 
                        a mix of online and face-to-face instruction has a variety of benefits. I will apply this new knowledge to my teaching and 
                        provide as many opportunities for online instruction as possible in my classroom by focusing instruction on learning, providing opportunities to collaborate with different people, being flexible, and providing immediate feedback to students.</p>
                        
                        <p>This course was also beneficial because it allowed the students in the class to learn by doing. I really enjoyed 
                        participating in projects such as the film editing project, the podcast project, and designing a curriculum as a group.
                        We were able to see firsthand the many ways technology can be used and how students can bring their own backgrounds into the 
                        classroom. I also learned in this course how to help students who have difficulty writing with speech-to-text recognition and 
                        language translation programs for English language learners. This course made me aware of how technology can help students 
                        collaborate and differentiate, and how they can become teachers themselves and take control of how their education is delivered 
                        to them. This course was extremely useful and I have begun to use this type of technology in my own classroom to make education 
                        more equitable and accessible to my students from diverse backgrounds. I am very grateful for the lessons I learned in this 
                        course and am excited to apply them in my classroom.</p>
